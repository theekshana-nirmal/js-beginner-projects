## Overview

This repository contains a series of projects that I developed as a second-year undergraduate to improve my JavaScript knowledge and coding discipline. Each project is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that the design adjusts gracefully across different devices.

## Project List

Below is a list of the projects included in this repository:

- **Colors** (Responsive Design)
- **Hex Colors** (Responsive Design)
- **Random Quote Generator** (Responsive Design)
- **Pass the Message** (Responsive Design)
- **Counter** (Responsive Design)
- **Image Carousel** (Responsive Design)
- **Digital Clock** (Responsive Design)
- **Calculator** (Responsive Design)
- **Grocery List** (Responsive Design)
- **Tip Calculator** (Responsive Design)
- **Flashcards with Local Storage** (Responsive)
- **To-do List** (Responsive Design)
- **Sticky Noteswmp4**
- **Timer**
- **Math for Kids Application**
- **Unsplash API Image Generator** (Responsive)
- **Quotes API Typewriter** (Responsive Design)
- **Square Cards** (Template Responsive)

Each project is contained within its own folder and includes a brief explanation along with the source code.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** – Core programming language used for logic and interactivity.
- **HTML** – Markup language for structuring the projects.
- **CSS** – Styling and responsive design.
- **APIs** – Used in projects like the Unsplash API Image Generator and Quotes API Typewriter.
- **Local Storage** – Implemented in the Flashcards project for data persistence.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with these projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. **Open any project folder in your preferred code editor.**For example, to open the Calculator project:
   ```bash
   cd calculator
   ```
4. **Open the project in your browser:**
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view and interact with the project.

## Usage

Each project is self-contained and designed to run in a modern web browser. Explore the code to see how JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and interact with APIs. You can also experiment by modifying the code to see how small changes affect the overall functionality.

Feel free to fork the repository and try your own enhancements or build additional projects inspired by these examples.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced projects as I continue to learn.
- Implement tests and debugging tools for each project.
- Improve code documentation and comments.
- Explore additional JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
